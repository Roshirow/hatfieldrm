        This product concept was my submission for my final in Production Design at Eastern Washington University, a cumulation of my effort across the entire quarter. The project goal was to design both a vessel for beer as well as packaging, logos, and branding surrounding the container. To properly research my product and packaging design I thought I would start at the source - I took a trip to some local breweries. I toured five facilities, from brewing and canning to labeling and marketing, including a one on one Q and A with several brewery owners. After an additional educational trip to Total Wine to look at the variety of labeling and packaging, I took pictures, sketched ideas, and took notes to guide my direction.

        <br><br> The project goal is to package beer with the quality that it was made. Doing so, glass is the best solution. Another project goal is to package beer with the great convenience that a can of beer offers for both the consumer and brewer.  
        
        <br><br>Glass bottles are basic and contain no other chemical ingredients besides the glass so there’s nothing in it that could change the taste. Cans are typically aluminum, lined on the inside with a polymer that can contain BPA or Bisphenol-A.  
        
        <br><br> I had to start somewhere, so I took a trip to the breweries. I took a tour of about five facilities and had a one on one Q and A about the process of making their beer. Then I went to one of the best well-known alcohol distributions: Total Wine. I went to look at all the other competitors that come from local breweries, but also different countries. I sketched ideas and took notes of all that I heard and witnessed, but I also took pictures.

        <br><br> My problem was difficult, but my solution is simple: a glass container with a round bottom, pillar-shaped that allows for more carbonation/bubbles.   
        
        <br><br> There was another variable added to the problem... through my research about why beer containers were designed the way they were- I discovered that the light from the sun had a huge effect with the taste and quality of the beer; that’s why most glass containers for beer are brown tinted. And with my creative color concepts, I chose blue as a light reflector.
